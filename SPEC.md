# Nexus RPC HTTP Specification

## Overview

The Nexus protocol, as specified below, is a synchronous RPC protocol. Arbitrary length operations are modelled on top
of a set of pre-defined synchronous RPCs.

A Nexus **caller** calls a **handler**. The handler may respond inline or return a reference for a future, asynchronous
operation. The caller can cancel an asynchronous operation, check for its outcome, or fetch its current state. The
caller can also specify a callback URL, which the handler uses to asynchronously deliver the result of an operation when
it is ready.

## Operation Addressability

An operation is addressed using the following components:

- The containing endpoint, a URL prefix (e.g. `http://api.mycompany.com/services/`)
- Service Name - A grouping of operations (e.g. `payments.v1`)
- Operation Name - A unique name for the given (e.g. `charge`)
- Operation Token - A unique token assigned by the handler as a response to a [StartOperation](#start-operation)
  request.

The service name and operation name MUST not be empty and may contain any arbitrary character sequence as long as
they're encoded into the URL.

An operation token MUST not be empty and contain only characters that are valid HTTP header values. When passing a token
as part of a URL path make sure any special characters are encoded.

## Schema Definitions

### Failure

The `Failure` object represents protocol level failures returned in non successful HTTP responses as well as `failed` or
`canceled` operation results. The object MUST adhere to the following JSON schema:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  message:
    type: string
    description: A simple text message.

  metadata:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A key-value mapping for additional context. Useful for decoding the 'details' field, if needed.

  details:
    type: any
    properties:
    description: |
      Additional JSON serializable structured data.
```

### OperationInfo

The `OperationInfo` object MUST adhere to the given schema:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  token:
    type: string
    description: |
      A token for referencing this operation.

  state:
    enum:
      - succeeded
      - failed
      - canceled
      - running
    description: |
      Describes the current state of an operation.
```

## Endpoint Descriptions

### Start Operation

Start an arbitrary length operation. The response of the operation may be delivered synchronously (inline), or
asynchronously, via a provided callback or the [Get Operation Result](#get-operation-result) endpoint.

**Path**: `/{service}/{operation}`

**Method**: `POST`

#### Query Parameters

- `callback`: Optional. If the operation is asynchronous, the handler should invoke this URL once the operation's result
  is available.

#### Request Headers

A client may attach arbitrary headers to the request.

Headers that start with the `Nexus-Callback-` prefix are expected to be attached to the callback request when invoked by
the handler. The callback request must strip away the `Nexus-Callback-` prefix. E.g if a Start Operation request
includes a `Nexus-Callback-Token: some-token` header, the callback request would include a `Token: some-token` header.

The `Operation-Timeout` header field can be added to inform the handler how long the caller is willing to wait for an
operation to complete. This is distinct from the more general `Request-Timeout` header which is used to indicate the
timeout for a single HTTP request. Format of this header value is number + unit, where unit can be `ms` for
milliseconds, `s` for seconds, and `m` for minutes.

The `Nexus-Link` header field can be added to associate resources with the start request. A handler may attach these
links as metadata to underlying resources to provide end-to-end observability. See the [`Nexus-Link`](#nexus-link)
section for more information.

#### Request Body

The body may contain arbitrary data. Headers should specify content type and encoding.

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Operation completed successfully. It may return `Nexus-Link` headers to associate resources with this
  operation.

  **Headers**:

  - `Nexus-Operation-State: succeeded`

  **Body**: Arbitrary data conveying the operation's result. Headers should specify content type and encoding.

- `201 Created`: Operation was started and will complete asynchronously. It may return `Nexus-Link` headers to associate
  resources with this operation.

  **Headers**:

  - `Content-Type: application/json`

  **Body**: A JSON serialized [`OperationInfo`](#operationinfo) object.

- `424 Failed Dependency`: Operation completed as `failed` or `canceled`.

  **Headers**:

  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Nexus-Operation-State: failed | canceled`

  **Body**: A JSON serialized [`Failure`](#failure) object.

- `409 Conflict`: This operation was already started with a different request ID.

  **Headers**:

  - `Content-Type: application/json`

  **Body**: A JSON serialized [`Failure`](#failure) object.

### Cancel Operation

Request to cancel an operation. The operation may later complete as canceled or any other outcome. Handlers should
ignore multiple cancelations of the same operation and return successfully if cancelation was already requested.

**Path**: `/{service}/{operation}/cancel`

**Method**: `POST`

#### Request Headers

The operation token received as a response to the Start Operation method. Must be delivered either via the `token` query
param or the `Nexus-Operation-Token` header field.

#### Query Parameters

- `token`: The operation token received as a response to the Start Operation method. Must be delivered either via the
  `token` query param or the `Nexus-Operation-Token` header field.

#### Response Codes

- `202 Accepted`: Cancelation request accepted.

  **Body**: Empty.

- `404 Not Found`: Operation token not recognized or references deleted.

  **Headers**:

  - `Content-Type: application/json`

  **Body**: A JSON serialized [`Failure`](#failure) object.

### Get Operation Result

Retrieve operation result.

**Path**: `/{service}/{operation}/result`

**Method**: `GET`

#### Request Headers

The operation token received as a response to the Start Operation method. Must be delivered either via the `token` query
param or the `Nexus-Operation-Token` header field.

#### Query Parameters

- `token`: The operation token received as a response to the Start Operation method. Must be delivered either via the
  `token` query param or the `Nexus-Operation-Token` header field.

- `wait`: Optional. Duration indicating the waiting period for a result, defaulting to no wait. If by the end of the
  wait period the operation is still running, the request should resolve with a 412 status code (see below).

  Format of this parameter is number + unit, where unit can be `ms` for milliseconds, `s` for seconds, and `m` for
  minutes. Examples:

  - `100ms`
  - `1m`
  - `5s`

#### Response Codes

- `200 OK`: Operation completed successfully.

  **Headers**:

  - `Nexus-Operation-State: succeeded`

  **Body**: Arbitrary data conveying the operation's result. Headers should specify content type and encoding.

- `408 Request Timeout`: The server gave up waiting for operation completion. The request may be retried by the caller.

  **Body**: Empty.

- `412 Precondition Failed`: Operation still running.

  When waiting for completion, the caller may re-issue this request to start a new long poll.

  **Body**: Empty.

- `424 Failed Dependency`: Operation completed as `failed` or `canceled`.

  **Headers**:

  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Nexus-Operation-State: failed | canceled`

  **Body**: A JSON serialized [`Failure`](#failure) object.

- `404 Not Found`: Operation token not recognized or references deleted.

## Predefined Handler Errors

For compatiblity of this HTTP spec with future transports, when a handler fails a request, it **should** use one of the
following predefined error codes.

| Name                 | Status Code | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BAD_REQUEST`        | 400         | The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. Clients should not retry this request unless advised otherwise.                       |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED`    | 401         | The client did not supply valid authentication credentials for this request. Clients should not retry this request unless advised otherwise.                             |
|                      |             |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `UNAUTHORIZED`       | 403         | The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation. Clients should not retry this request unless advised otherwise.                                  |
|                      |             |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `NOT_FOUND`          | 404         | The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible but not advised.                         |
|                      |             |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | 429         | Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.        |
| `INTERNAL`           | 500         | An internal error occured. Clients should not retry this request unless advised otherwise.                                                                               |
| `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`    | 501         | The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request. Clients should not retry this request unless advised otherwise. |
| `UNAVAILABLE`        | 503         | The service is currently unavailable. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.                                                                                 |
| `UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`   | 520         | Used by gateways to report that a request to an upstream server has timed out. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.                                        |

## General Purpose Headers

### `Nexus-Link`

The `Nexus-Link` header field provides a means for serializing one or more links in HTTP headers. This header is encoded
the same way as the HTTP header `Link` described [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link).

Handlers and callers can specify links in different Nexus requests to associate an operation with arbitrary resources.

Links must contain a `type` parameter that expresses how they should be parsed.

**Example**: `Nexus-Link: <myscheme://somepath?k=v>; type="com.example.MyResource"`

### `Nexus-Request-Retryable`

Handlers may specify the `Nexus-Request-Retryable` header to explicitly instruct a caller whether or not to retry a
request. Unless specified, retry behavior is determined from the
[predefined handler error type](#predefined-handler-errors). For example `INTERNAL` errors is not retryable by default
unless specified otherwise.

### `Request-Timeout`

Callers may specify the `Request-Timeout` header on all APIs to inform the handler how long they're willing to wait for
a response.

Format of this header value is number + unit, where unit can be `ms` for milliseconds, `s` for seconds, and `m` for
minutes.

## Callback URLs

Any HTTP URL can be used to deliver operation completions.

Callers should ensure URLs contain sufficient information to correlate completions with initiators.

For invoking a callback URL:

- Issue a POST request to the caller-provided URL.
- Include any callback headers supplied in the originating StartOperation request, stripping away the `Nexus-Callback-`
  prefix.
- Include the `Nexus-Operation-Token` header, `Nexus-Operation-Start-Time` and any `Nexus-Link` headers for resources
  associated with this operation to support completing asynchronous operations before the response to StartOperation is
  received. `Nexus-Operation-Start-Time` should be in a valid HTTP format described
  [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.html#section-3.3). If is omitted, the time the completion is received
  will be used as operation start time.
- Include the `Nexus-Operation-State` header.
- If state is `succeeded`, deliver non-empty results in the body with corresponding `Content-*` headers.
- If state is `failed` or `canceled`, content type should be `application/json` and the body must have a serialized
  [`Failure`](#failure) object.
- Upon successful completion delivery, the handler should reply with a `200 OK` status and an empty body.

### Security

There's no enforced security for callback URLs at this time. However, some specific Nexus server implementations may
deliver additional details as headers or have other security requirements of the callback endpoint. When starting an
operation, callers may embed a signed token into the URL, which can be verified upon delivery of completion.

[rfc3986-section-2.3]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3

## Content Types

Nexus is not opinionated about request content types, although typically, inputs and outputs are transmitted as JSON
with content type `application/json`. Other common types include nulls, where the content type is left empty, and byte
buffers, with content type `application/octet-stream`.

### Protocol Buffers

[Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) messages support two serialization formats, binary, and JSON.

The standard way to transmit binary serialized protos over Nexus is to attach the following `content-type` header:

```
application/x-protobuf; message-type=com.example.MyMessage
```

The standard way to transmit JSON serialized protos over Nexus is to attach the following `content-type` header:

```
application/json; format=protobuf; message-type=com.example.MyMessage
```

Note that in both cases, the message-type is the fully qualified proto message name. The message-type param is used to
look up the message in the proto registry in languages that do not have runtime type information. Languages that do have
support for runtime types, should validate that the message type in the header matches the value to deserialize into.

## Q/A

1. What potential security concerns should be taken into consideration while implementing this protocol?

Security is not part of this specification, but as this is a thin layer on top of HTTP, standard practices should be
used to secure these APIs. For securing callback URLs, see [Callback URLs > Security](#security).
